The novels chosen this year cover themes such as overcoming racism, dealing with adversity, and finding oneself in the world. Whenever possible, we will be drawing on ideas from the max warburg courage curriculum, an award-winning 6th, grade curriculum used in many massachusetts schools. excerpts from muslim authors will be included whenever possible. in addition to reading classic novels and short stories together as a class, students will be expected to complete at least one free reading book per trimester. students will keep a free response journal, produce at least one graded, revised writing assignment per month, and have bi-weekly vocabulary, grammar, and reading tests. finally, students will participate in numerous local and state contests such as: Boston Courage essay contest, massachusetts science poetry contest, letters about literature, muslim poetry contest, and a vocabulary bee. learning objectives by the completion of this course the successful student should have learned (for specific standards, please see the end of this document): 1.
