Sentence and Parts of a Sentence  A sentence is the largest unit of any language. In English, it begins with a captial letter and ends with a full-stop, or a question mark, or an exclamation mark. The sentence is generally defined as a word or a group of words that expresses a through idea by giving a statement/order, or asking a question, or exclaiming. Example: He is a good boy. (statement), Is he a good boy? (question), What a nice weather! (exclaiming). Ideally, a sentence requires at least one subject and one verb. Sometimes the subject of a sentence can be hidden, but the verb must be visible and present in the sentence. Verb is called the heart of a sentence. Example: Do it. (In this sentence, a subject 'you' is hidden but verb 'do' is visible) In other words, a complete English sentence must have three characteristics: First, int written form, a sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a period (i.e., a full stop)[.], a note of interrogation (i.e., a question mark) [?], or a note of exclamation (i.e., an exclamation mark) [!]. Second, it must express a complete thought, not fragmented. Third, it must contain at least one subject (hidden/visible) and one verb comprising an independent clause. (An independent clause contains an independent subject and verb and expresses a complete thought.)
