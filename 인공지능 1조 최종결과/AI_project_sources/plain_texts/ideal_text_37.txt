The second thing that we will do will be to lighten the load of the study of the foreign languages. in spite of a long stay in india no european can speak for a couple of hours fluent marathi, while our graduates are required as a rule to obtain proficiency in the english language. one who speaks and writes good english is said, in these days, to have benn educated. but a mere knowledge of the language is no true education. such a compulsion of the study of foreign languages does not exist anywhere except in indea, we spend twenty or twenty-five years for the education which we can easily obtain in seven or eight years if we get it through the medium of our vernaculars. we cannot help learning english; but there is no reason why its-study should be made compulsory. under the mahomedan rule we were required to learn persian but we were not, compelled to study it. to save unnecessary waste of time we have proposed to give education through our own vernaculars - lokmanya bal gangadhar tilak
