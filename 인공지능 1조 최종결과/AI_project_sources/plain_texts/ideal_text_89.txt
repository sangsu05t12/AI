Bonus. There is a special type of English sentence that linguists refer to as "donkey sentences." Two typical examples of such sentence are the following: (a) Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it. (b) If a farmer own a donkey, he beats it. Try translating on (or both!) of these sentences into Predicate Logic. What problens (if any) do you run into when attempting to do so? Discuss any solutions you might try to resolve these problems(ie to the translations, to the meta-language, etc). [10 points] For the record, ther is a way to translate these sentences into Predicate Logic, but the translations are somewhat...surprising. If you think you've figured out the translation for one, explain what seems to be unexpected about it. Even if you can't get this translation, show your best attempt and explain why it doesn't seen quite right.
