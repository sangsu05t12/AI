Miki suzuki 9 April 2020 My Day I am very busy there days. I am always in a hurry and don't have time to think. I get up at six o'clock every morning to get to school on time. I have five classes every day, and after that, I go to work at a coffee shop int the evenings. I get home at midnight, take a bath and go to bed. The next day it all begins again. I really need a break.
