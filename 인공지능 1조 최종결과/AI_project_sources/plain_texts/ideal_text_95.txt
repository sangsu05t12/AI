The perks of Advertising Level: Intermediate Goal: Students will be able to develop critical judgement and to produce a good advertisement that will persuade the "byers". Length: 45 minutes Material: Cards with the products' images. Step 1: The teacher must do tickets with the studens' names. Ruffle five names to be the buyers and the other will be paired as the advertisers. Step 2: Each pair must pick a card, without looking (see cards below). a. Each card has an image of a "product". b. The students haver to "sell" their product no matter what they end up with. Step 3: the advertisers will have about 5 minutes to create a 1-minute, at most, advertisement, that will make the buyers believe the product is good enough to be bought. a. While each pair present their product and try to sell it, the teacher will time it with a one-minute hourglass. b. The sellers/advertisers can present their product in less than one minute, but they cannot exceed this time. Step 4: After each advertising, the "buyers" will have to judge the advertisements, giving a tip or critic for each pair (how they could improve or why they wouldn't buy it or why it is a sell); besides having to grade each one from 8 to 10. a. The scores must be noted and will be used later to choose the winners. Note: The evaluation will happen by the ablillity of short-time thinking and the students speaking skills. Attachment: Cards
