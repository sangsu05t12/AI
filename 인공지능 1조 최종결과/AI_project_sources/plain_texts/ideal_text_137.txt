Using English at an advanced level is not as simple as learning rules: it can be flexible, regionally specific or individual. In writing, many of these areas can be grouped under the label style.

To be clear about what is not a matter of style, some errors, such as grammar or spelling mistakes, may be clearly incorrect: Tim eats a cake yesterday.

In writing, such style choices go beyond what  7
