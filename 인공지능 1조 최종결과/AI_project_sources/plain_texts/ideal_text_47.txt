Create a program in either c++ or perl to take an english sentence and convert each word in the sentence to pig latin. Preserve case and any punctuation. you may use the program from lecture as a guide and starting point. +10 bonus points if you can make the program prompt for additional sentences and convert them until the user types a sentence consisting of only the single word "quit" I would recommend if you are attempting the bonus to turn in the first part as one file and then create a second program that does the bonus part. this will insure you will get full credit for the main assignment if your bonus doesn't work.
