English Sentence Structure: 4 Types
Of English Sentences
SIMPLE SENTENCE
A simple sentence contains one independent clause.
What's an “independent clause”? It's one subject followed by one verb or verb phrase. It
expresses a single idea.
Examples of simple sentences:
= I'm happy.
« Robert doesn’t eat meat.
+ My brother and | went to the mall last night.
+ This new laptop computer has already crashed twice.
Notice that a “simple sentence” isn't necessarily short. The subject can be a single word like “I” or
“Robert,” or it can be a double subject like "my brother and I.” or it can be multiple words:
deseribing a single person/object, like “This new laptop computer.”
COMPOUND SENTENCE
A compound sentence has two independent clauses joined by a linking word (and. but. or, so.
yet, however).
Each independent clause could be a sentence by itself, but we connect them with a linking word:
+ I'm happy, but my kids are always complaining.
« Robert doesn’t eat meat, so Barbara made a special vegetarian dish for him.
+ My brother and | went to the mall last night, but we didn't buy anything.
«This new laptop computer has already crashed twice, anc | have no idea why.
Note that each sentence has TWO subjects and TWO verb phrases.
