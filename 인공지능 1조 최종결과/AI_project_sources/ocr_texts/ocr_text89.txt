‘Tey translating one (or both!) of these sentences into Predicate Logic. What problems
(if any) do you rim into when attempting to do so? Discuss any solutions you might try
to resolve these problems (ie to the translations. 1o the meta-language. etc). (10 points]
For the record, there is a way (o translate these sentences into Predicate Logic, but the
translations are somewhat. .. surprising. If you think you've figured out the translation
for ane, explain what serms to he unexpected about it, Even if yon can't get this
translation, show your best attempt and explain why it doesn’t seem quite right
