6th Grade English Course Overview
The sixth grade English course seeks to kindle a lifelong love of reading and writing in its
students. The course will help students make the critical leap from focusing on superficial
questions like “What?” and “Who!” to exploring deeper questions like “Why?” and “How?” The
novels chosen this year cover themes such as overcoming racism, dealing with adversity, and
finding oneself in the world. Whenever possible, we will be drawing on ideas from the Max
Warburg Courage Curriculum, an award-winning 6" grade curriculum used in many
Massachusetts schools, Excerpts from Muslim authors will be included whenever possible,
In addition to reading classic novels and short stories together as a class, students will be
expected to complete at least one free reading book per trimester. Students will keep a free
response journal, produce at least one graded, revised writing assignment per month, and have
bi-weekly vocabulary, grammar, and reading tests, Finally, students will participate in numerous
local and state contests such as: Boston Courage Fssay Contest, Massachusetts Science Poetry
Contest, Letters about Literature, Muslim Poetry Contest, and a vocabulary bee.
