The second thing that we will do will be to lighten the load of the study of the
foreign languages. In spite of a long stay in India no European can speak for a
couple of hours fluent Marathi, while our graduates arerequiredas arule to obtain
proficiency in the English language. One who speaks and writes good English is
said, in these days. to have been educated, But a mere knowledge of the language
is no true education, Such a compulsion for the study of foreign languages does not
exist anywhere except in India, We spend twenty or twenty-five years for the
education which we can easily obtain in seven or eight years if we get it through
themedium of our vernacular, We cannot help learning English: but there is no
reason why its- study should be made compulsory. Under the Mahomedan rule we
were required to learn Persian but we were not, compelled to study it. To save
unnecessary waste of time we have proposed to give education through our own
vernaculars
