Sentence Structure
1. What is Sentence Structure?
Asentence’s “structure” is the way its words are
arranged.
In English, we have four main sentence
structures: the simple sentence, the compound
sentence, the complex sentence, and
the compound-complex sentence. Each uses a
specific combination of independent and dependent
clauses to help make sure that our sentences are
strong, informational, and most importantly, that
they make sense!
2. Examples of Sentence
Structures
In the examples, independent clauses are green,
dependent clauses are purple, and conjunctions
are orange. Here are examples of each type of
sentence:

1. The dog ran.

Simple Sentence
2. The dog ran and he ate popcorn.
