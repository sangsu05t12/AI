Introduction to Sentence Structure
The two fundamental parts of every English sentence are the subject and the predicate. A
simple sentence can also be described as a group of words expressing a complete thought.
Subjects can be described as the component that performs the action described by the
Predicate.
SUBJECT + PREDICATE = SENTENCE
A simple sentence or independent clause must have a verb. A verb shows action or state
of being. The subject tells who or what about the verb.
SUBJECT + VERB = SENTENCE
