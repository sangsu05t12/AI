Declarative sentences &
Declarative sentences in English consist of a subject and predicate. The verb in the
predicate is conjugated appropriately for the subject and in a specific tense:

subject + predicate
Mary + speaks English.

Let’s look at some examples that illustrate this. Declarative sentences can
have a singular or plural noun as their subject and can be followed by a verb in any
tense and by the complement of the sentence.

John repairs the car.
The boys ran into the forest.

Other declarative sentences use a pronoun as their subject, and again the
tense of the sentence can vary.

She has never been to England. singular-pronoun subject,
present-perfect-tense verb

We shall visit them soon. plural-pronoun subject,
future-tense verb

Since English verbs can show an incomplete action or one in progress (he is
going) or a completed or habitual action (he goes), when changing tenses, you
have to conform to the type of action of the verb. For example:

he is going, he was going, he has been going
he goes, he went, he has gone

The conjugation of English verbs is, with few exceptions, a relatively simple
matter, but using the proper tenses of verbs is something else. It is particularly
important to understand the tense differences between verbs that describe an
action in progress and verbs that describe a completed or habitual action.

Incomplete actions
Let’s look at some sentences that illustrate the meaning of incomplete actions—or
ones in progress—in the present, past, and future tenses. Note that in some cases,
it is an interruption of some kind that causes the action to be incomplete. (To the
right of the examples are italicized clarifications that will help you fully under-
stand the example sentences.)
